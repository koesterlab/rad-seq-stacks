Workflow Sanity Checks

This file offers views into the files during certain break points to check,
if reads are processed properly.
For example:

* Are spacers trimmed out correctly?
* Are DBRs/ UMIs removed correctly?
* Are too many reads dropped during extraction?
* Is the read file for any individual empty?
